# Age_prediction
This project can produce various neural networks used in computer vision.
It implements classic Convolutional, Residual and Inception Neural Networks.
I use it to predict age of a person form an cropped and aligned image of their face.

### Dataset
https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/?fbclid=IwAR0WHQx0nQ3t2KsQFs7WXMPBq2vABYbfTXzIQjb2qxlXG2zzQYAkfWe-4Ic

### Findings
All of the networks achieve good results. Even short training can obtain results with average error of 5-7 years.
